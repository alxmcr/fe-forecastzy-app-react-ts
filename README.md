# Forecastzy App ‚òÄÔ∏è

In Reservamos we're always looking for ways to help our users have the best
experience when looking for travel options so that they can make the best
decision when reserving a bus or flight ticket. To accomplish this, we have to
make an app where the users can check the weather forecast for the
destinations available in Reservamos üöç.

The web app's functionality is to be able to compare the weather forecast for
the next 7 days, by day, of different destinations offered by Reservamos. The
user must be able to input the name of cities and see the maximum and
minimum temperature for these places

  git clone https://github.com/alxmcr/forecastzy-app
```

Go to the project's directory

```bash
  cd forecastzy-app

Install the dependencies using NPM:

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the Frontend server:

```bash
  npm run start

## Environment Variables

We use the following environment variables to configure the app:

```
REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY=your-open-weather-api-key
```

You can get `your-open-weather-api-key` from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api)

We need to set the `REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY` environment variable in a file called `.env` in the project's root directory. You can find the `.env-sample` file in the repository's root directory as guide.
